##PRM Web Portal


###Overview

The PRM Web Portal is an application that allows the client users to view the reports for the group(s) they are associated with. The application also allows the Client User Administrators to launch Client User Administration Console application, and the Client Publishers to launch Client Publisher Console application.

Access to the Client User Administration Console and the Client Publisher Console requires special rights. If the menu items are not visible in the web portal once successfully logged in – your account has not been granted rights for access to the additional PRM components.

In compliance with HIPAA, the PRM web portal will automatically log out the user after a period of user inactivity as determined by HIPAA regulations.

Password complexity rules are governed by HIPAA regulations and apply to user password creation for new accounts and password resets.


###Web Portal Users

There are 3 kinds of user permissions of the PRM Web Portal:

-   Client Users

-   Client User Administrators

A user’s access to various features described in this guide will depend on the user’s permissions
