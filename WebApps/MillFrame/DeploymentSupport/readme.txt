These batch files are originally written to live in the prestaging sandbox 
and are used as part of the procedure to promote the solution from prestaging 
to staging.  A thought is to adapt these to support movement of deployed 
code from any sandbox to any other sandbox based on command line arguments.  

If there are changes please think of updating or removing this file.
